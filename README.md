# MIPS

A 16-bit MIPS Pipeline Processor implemented in VHDL, designed to execute instructions efficiently through a five-stage pipeline: Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Writeback. This project supports fundamental arithmetic, logical, and control operations, optimizing performance through instruction parallelism.
